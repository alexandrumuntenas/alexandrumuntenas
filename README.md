### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I'm Alexandru, an amateur programmer. I'm learning to program in Javascript and NodeJS and to combine these with databases like MariaDB and MySQL, APIs like Google Books, etc.

I am an ESO student and I am learning to program independently. So if you ever check any repository of mine and see some nonsense, I ask you to please leave a comment explaining *Why* it's wrong and *How* it can be done better.

Thank you very much and I hope you have a nice day.
